->Functional Interface
	->Functional Interface are interface that have only abstract method.
	->They serve as the basis for lambda expressions and method references, allowing you to pass behavior around as if it were data.
	->U can have static and default method.
	->supplier, consumer, Function, Predicate, unaryoperator,BinaryOperator,BiFunction, Biconsumer.These used to write lambda expression.
->Lamda expression
	->Its an expression used to create anonymous function.
	->it reduce code writing make it concise and compact.

How to write a lambda expression:
@funtionalInterface
public interface Test{
	void test();
}

public class Main{
 void main(){
	Test t=()->System.out.println("hi i am lambda);
